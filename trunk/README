First of all: Since I built in the optimized allocator for active
sets, the C++ wrapper appears to be broken. So do _not_ use it in this
release. When the C core of the library stabilizes, I will continue to
work on the C++ wrapper, again.

For more information about MAReN, go to the doc directory and try to
build the reference manual using Doxygen (If you don't have it,
http://www.doxygen.org might bring you there?!).

There are some brief descriptions for the package-specific
configuration options:

--enable-build-config = (dev|ship)
==================================
By default, autoconf sets the compiler flags -g -O2. If you want
something different - as I do e.g. during development - you may set
this option to

- dev : This will give you -ggdb -Wall as compile flags instead of the
  defaults.

- ship: This sets the compile flags -O2 -NDEBUG which will give you
  optimization and removes all the asserts, which I made extensive
  use. Removing the standard assert() should be safe. For assertions,
  that check for runtime-dependent conditions, there is
  MAREN_RT_ASSERT, which you cannot switch off.


--enable-check-node-casts = (yes|no) [default=no]
=================================================
This is a pure development feature, which can safely be switched off
in carefully tested distributions. The background of this feature is
the OO design (single inheritance) of the rete network nodes. The
design leads to a lot of casts between the different nodes types. The
lib has means to check, whether a cast is legal or not (comparable to
the dynamic_cast<>() of C++).

--enable-pmf-conversion = (yes|no) [default=yes]
================================================
This feature is for the C++ wrapper. It lets one pass C++ objects and
one of their member-functions to the C API callbacks. Without
pmf-conversion (convert bound pointer to member functions into plain C
function pointers), I had to write special wrapper functions, which
are not yet implemented.

--enable=custom-as-allocator = (yes|no) [default=no]
====================================================
Active Sets (as) are those things, which are rapidly allocated and
deallocated during fact-insertion and fact-removal. So using a custom
allocator for active-sets might speed up thing significantly. This
allocator is not yet carefully tested, but seems to work in the
supplied unit tests. However, there are still no benchmark, which make
the performance measurable.
